===========================================
Python compiler for the Neo Virtual Machine
===========================================

The ``neo-boa`` compiler is a tool for compiling Python files to the ``.avm`` format for usage in the `Neo Virtual Machine <https://github.com/neo-project/neo-vm/>`_. The latter is used to execute contracts on the `Neo Blockchain <https://github.com/neo-project/neo/>`_.

The compiler supports a subset of the Python language (in the same way that a Boa Contstrictor is a subset of the Python snake species.)
